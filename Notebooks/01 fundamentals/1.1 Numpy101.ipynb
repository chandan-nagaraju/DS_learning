    "\n",
    "NumPy arrays are faster and more compact than Python lists. An array consumes less memory and is convenient to use. NumPy uses much less memory to store data and it provides a mechanism of specifying the data types. This allows the code to be optimized even further."

It has a grid of elements that can be indexed in various ways. The elements are all of the same type, referred to as the **array dtype**."
